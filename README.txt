CC1310 Demo Code

This repository contains several projects to be used with the CC1310. These particular projects served as the code for demoing the functionality of the CC1310 Blade. The ADC Projects involve sending input data through packets to be read and processed. The REVC Projects involve pressing a button in order to manipulate the values of another board's pin outputs.
